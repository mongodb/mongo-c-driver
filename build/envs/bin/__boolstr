# otherwise "false". stdout from the subcommand will be supressed. stderr will
# be forwarded. This script itself will always exit zero.

# The intent is that this script's output can be stored in a variable which can
# later be used as a "true" or "false" command in conditions.

# Usage: __boolstr [cmd...]

mongoc_uri(7)
=============


NAME
----
mongoc_uri - MongoDB uri abstraction


SYNOPSIS
--------

[source, c]
---------------
#include <mongoc.h>

mongoc_uri_t * uri;

uri = mongoc_uri_new(uri_string);
---------------


DESCRIPTION
-----------
_mongoc_uri_ provides an abstraction on top of the MongoDB connection uri
format.  It provides standardized parsing as well as convenience methods for
extracting useful information such as replica hosts or authorization
information.


CONNECTION STRING FORMAT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

--------------------------
mongodb://                                   <1>
   [username:password@]                      <2>
   host1                                     <3>
   [:port1]                                  <4>
   [,host2[:port2],...[,hostN[:portN]]]      <5>
   [/[database]                              <6>
   [?options]]                               <7>
--------------------------

<1> mongodb is the specifier of the MongoDB protocol
<2> An optional username and password
<3> The only required part of the uri.  This specifies either a hostname, IP
    address or UNIX domain socket
<4> An optional port number.  Defaults to :27017
<5> Extra optional hosts and ports.  You would specify multiple hosts, for
    example, for connections to replica sets
<6> The name of the database to authenticate if the connection string includes
    authentication credentials.  If /database is not specified and the
    connection string includes credentials, defaults to the 'admin' database
<7> Connection specific options.  See <<options, Connection String Options>>
    for more detail.  If /database was not passed, you must specfiy a slash
    between the last host and the question mark that begins the string of
    options.

.Basic Replica Set URI
=========================
To describe a connection to a replica set named 'test.  with the following
mongod hosts:

* db1.example.net on port 27017 and
* db2.example.net on port 2500

You would use a connection string that resembles the following:
--------------------------
mongodb://db1.example.net,db2.example.net:2500/?replicaSet=test
--------------------------
=========================

CONNECTION STRING OPTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[[options]]

REPLICA SET OPTIONS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

replicaSet::
   Specifies the name of the replica set, if the mongod is a member of a
   replica set.  When connecting to a replica set it is important to give a
   seed list of at least two mongod instances. If you only provide the
   connection point of a single mongod instance, and omit the replicaSet, the
   client will create a standalone connection.

CONNECTION OPTIONS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ssl::
   The default value is false
   true;; Initiate the connection with SSL
   false;; Initiate the connection without SSL

connectTimeoutMS::
   The time in milliseconds to attempt a connection before timing out. The
   default is never to timeout

socketTimeoutMS::
   The time in milliseconds to attempt a send or receive on a socket before the
   attempt times out. The default is never to timeout

CONNECTION POOL OPTIONS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

maxPoolSize::
   The maximum number of connections in the connection pool. The default value
   is 100

minPoolSize::
   The minimum number of connections in the connection pool. The default value
   is 0

maxIdleTimeMS::
   UNIMPLEMENTED - The maximum number of milliseconds that a connection can
   remain idle in the pool before being removed and closed

waitQueueMultiple::
   UNIMPLEMENTED - A number that the driver multiples the maxPoolSize value to,
   to provide the maximum number of threads allowed to wait for a connection to
   become available from the pool.

uri.waitQueueTimeoutMS::
   UNIMPLEMENTED - The maximum time in milliseconds that a thread can wait for
   a connection to become available. For default values, see the MongoDB
   Drivers and Client Libraries documentation.

WRITE CONCERN OPTIONS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

w::
   -1;;
      The driver will not acknowledge write operations and will suppress all
      network or socket errors.
   0;;
      The driver will not acknowledge write operations but will pass or handle
      any network and socket errors that it receives to the client. If you
      disable write concern but enable the getLastError command’s w option, w
      overrides the w option.
   1;;
      Provides basic acknowledgment of write operations. By specifying 1, you
      require that a standalone mongod instance, or the primary for replica
      sets, acknowledge all write operations. For drivers released after the
      default write concern change, this is the default write concern setting.
   "majority";;
      For replica sets, if you specify the special majority value to w option,
      write operations will only return successfully after a majority of the
      configured replica set members have acknowledged the write operation.
   n;;
      For replica sets, if you specify a number n greater than 1, operations
      with this write concern return only after n members of the set have
      acknowledged the write. If you set n to a number that is greater than the
      number of available set members or members that hold data, MongoDB will
      wait, potentially indefinitely, for these members to become available.
   "tags";;
      For replica sets, you can specify a tag set to require that all members
      of the set that have these tags configured return confirmation of the
      write operation.

wtimeoutMS::
   The time in milliseconds to wait for replication to succeed, as specified in
   the w option, before timing out. When wtimeoutMS is 0, write operations will
   never time out.

journal::
   Controls whether write operations will wait until the mongod acknowledges
   the write operations and commits the data to the on disk journal.
   true;;
      Enables journal commit acknowledgment write concern. Equivalent to
      specifying the getLastError command with the j option enabled.
   false;;
      Does not require that mongod commit write operations to the journal
      before acknowledging the write operation. This is the default option for
      the journal parameter.

READ PREFERENCE OPTIONS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

readPreference::
   Specifies the replica set read preference for this connection. This setting
   overrides any slaveOk value. The read preference values are the following:

   * primary
   * primaryPreferred
   * secondary
   * secondaryPreferred
   * nearest

readPreferenceTags::
   Specifies a tag set as a comma-separated list of colon-separated key-value
   pairs

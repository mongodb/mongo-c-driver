/**
 * @brief Test for timer expiration
 *
 * @param timer The timer to be tested
 * @param once (Optional) A pointer to an optional once-flag that will be set
 * to `true` (see below)
 *
 * The function behaves as follows:
 *
 * - If `once` is a null pointer, then returns a boolean indicating whether the
 *   timer has expired.
 * - Otherwise, if `*once` is `true`:
 *   - If `timer` has expired, returns `true`
 *   - Otherwise, `*once` is set to `true` and returns `false`
 *
 * The intent of the `once` flag is to support loops that check for expiry,
 * where at least one iteration of the loop *must* be attempted, even if the
 * timer has expired. For example:
 *
 * ```
 *      void do_thing() {
 *          bool once = false;
 *          while (!mlib_timer_is_expired(timer, &once)) {
 *              try_thing(timer);
 *          }
 *      }
 * ```
 *
 * In the above, `try_thing` will be called *at least once*, even if the timer
 * is already expired.

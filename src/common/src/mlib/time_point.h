 * @brief A point-in-time type
 * @date 2025-04-17
 *
 * The `mlib_time_point` type represents a stable point-in-time. The time point
 * itself is relative to a monotonic clock for the program, so it should not be
 * transmitted or persisted outside of the execution of a program that uses it.

    * reference point in the past. That stable reference point may change between

    * relationship to other time points created with different clocks. For this reason,
    * this member should not be set to any absolute values, and should only be adjusted

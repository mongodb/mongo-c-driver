mongoc_gridfs_t
===============

.. warning::

  This GridFS implementation does not conform to the `MongoDB GridFS specification <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/gridfs/gridfs-spec.md>`_. For a spec compliant implementation, use :symbol:`mongoc_gridfs_bucket_t`.

Synopsis
--------

.. code-block:: c

  #include <mongoc/mongoc.h>

  typedef struct _mongoc_gridfs_t mongoc_gridfs_t;

Description
-----------

``mongoc_gridfs_t`` provides a MongoDB gridfs implementation. The system as a whole is made up of ``gridfs`` objects, which contain ``gridfs_files`` and ``gridfs_file_lists``.  Essentially, a basic file system API.

There are extensive caveats about the kind of use cases gridfs is practical for. In particular, any writing after initial file creation is likely to both break any concurrent readers and be quite expensive. That said, this implementation does allow for arbitrary writes to existing gridfs object, just use them with caution.

mongoc_gridfs also integrates tightly with the :symbol:`mongoc_stream_t` abstraction, which provides some convenient wrapping for file creation and reading/writing.  It can be used without, but its worth looking to see if your problem can fit that model.

.. warning::

  ``mongoc_gridfs_t`` does not support read preferences. In a replica set, GridFS queries are always routed to the primary.

Thread Safety
-------------

``mongoc_gridfs_t`` is NOT thread-safe and should only be used in the same thread as the owning :symbol:`mongoc_client_t`.

Lifecycle
---------

It is an error to free a ``mongoc_gridfs_t`` before freeing all related instances of :symbol:`mongoc_gridfs_file_t` and :symbol:`mongoc_gridfs_file_list_t`.

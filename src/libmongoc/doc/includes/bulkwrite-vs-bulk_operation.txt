If using MongoDB server 8.0+, prefer :symbol:`mongoc_bulkwrite_t` over :symbol:`mongoc_bulk_operation_t` to reduce
network round trips.

:symbol:`mongoc_bulkwrite_t` uses the ``bulkWrite`` server command introduced in MongoDB server 8.0. ``bulkWrite``
command supports insert, update, and delete operations in the same payload. ``bulkWrite`` supports use of multiple
collection namespaces in the same payload.

:symbol:`mongoc_bulk_operation_t` uses the ``insert``, ``update`` and ``delete`` server commands available in all
current MongoDB server versions. Write operations are grouped by type (insert, update, delete) and sent in separate
commands. Only one collection may be specified per bulk write.

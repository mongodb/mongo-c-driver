``opts`` may be NULL or a BSON document with additional command options:

* ``batchSize``: An ``int32`` representing number of documents requested to be returned on each call to :symbol:`mongoc_change_stream_next`
* ``resumeAfter``: A ``Document`` representing the logical starting point of the change stream. The result of :symbol:`mongoc_change_stream_get_resume_token()` or the ``_id`` field  of any change received from a change stream can be used here. This option is mutually exclusive with ``startAfter`` and ``startAtOperationTime``.
* ``startAfter``: A ``Document`` representing the logical starting point of the change stream. Unlike ``resumeAfter``, this can resume notifications after an "invalidate" event. The result of :symbol:`mongoc_change_stream_get_resume_token()` or the ``_id`` field  of any change received from a change stream can be used here.  This option is mutually exclusive with ``resumeAfter`` and ``startAtOperationTime``.
* ``startAtOperationTime``: A ``Timestamp``. The change stream only provides changes that occurred at or after the specified timestamp. Any command run against the server will return an operation time that can be used here. This option is mutually exclusive with ``resumeAfter`` and ``startAfter``.
* ``maxAwaitTimeMS``: An ``int64`` representing the maximum amount of time a call to :symbol:`mongoc_change_stream_next` will block waiting for data
* ``fullDocument``: An optional UTF-8 string. Set this option to "default", "updateLookup", "whenAvailable", or "required", If unset, The string "default" is assumed. Set this option to "updateLookup" to direct the change stream cursor to lookup the most current majority-committed version of the document associated to an update change stream event.
* ``fullDocumentBeforeChange``: An optional UTF-8 string. Set this option to "whenAvailable", "required", or "off". When unset, the default value is "off". Similar to "fullDocument", but returns the value of the document before the associated change.
* ``showExpandedEvents``: Set to ``true`` to return an expanded list of change stream events. Available only on MongoDB versions >=6.0
* ``comment``: A :symbol:`bson_value_t` specifying the comment to attach to this command. The comment will appear in log messages, profiler output, and currentOp output. Only string values are supported prior to MongoDB 4.4.

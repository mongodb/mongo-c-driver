``opts`` may be NULL or a BSON document with additional command options:

* ``collation``: Configure textual comparisons. See `Setting Collation Order <setting_collation_order_>`_, and `the MongoDB Manual entry on Collation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/collation/>`_. Collation requires MongoDB 3.2 or later, otherwise an error is returned.
* ``hint``: A document or string that specifies the index to use to support the query predicate.

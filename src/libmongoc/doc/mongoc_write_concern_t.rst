mongoc_write_concern_t
======================

Write Concern abstraction

Synopsis
--------

``mongoc_write_concern_t`` tells the driver what level of acknowledgement to await from the server. The default, MONGOC_WRITE_CONCERN_W_DEFAULT, is right for the great majority of applications.

You can specify a write concern on connection objects, database objects, collection objects, or per-operation. Data-modifying operations typically use the write concern of the object they operate on, and check the server response for a write concern error or write concern timeout. For example, :symbol:`mongoc_collection_drop_index` uses the collection's write concern, and a write concern error or timeout in the response is considered a failure.

Exceptions to this principle are the generic command functions:

* :symbol:`mongoc_client_command_simple`
* :symbol:`mongoc_database_command_simple`
* :symbol:`mongoc_collection_command_simple`

These generic command functions do not automatically apply a write concern, and they do not check the server response for a write concern error or write concern timeout.

See `Write Concern <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/write-concern/>`_ on the MongoDB website for more information.

Write Concern Levels
--------------------

Set the write concern level with :symbol:`mongoc_write_concern_set_w`.

==========================================  ===============================================================================================================================================================================================================
MONGOC_WRITE_CONCERN_W_DEFAULT (1)          By default, writes block awaiting acknowledgement from MongoDB. Acknowledged write concern allows clients to catch network, duplicate key, and other errors.
MONGOC_WRITE_CONCERN_W_UNACKNOWLEDGED (0)   With this write concern, MongoDB does not acknowledge the receipt of write operation. Unacknowledged is similar to errors ignored; however, mongoc attempts to receive and handle network errors when possible.
MONGOC_WRITE_CONCERN_W_MAJORITY (majority)  Block until a write has been propagated to a majority of the nodes in the replica set.
n                                           Block until a write has been propagated to at least ``n`` nodes in the replica set.

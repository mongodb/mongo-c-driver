# This file lists known failing or flaky tests that for some reason or another
# cannot be fixed and rather should be skipped in Evergreen builds.  Note that
# listing a test in this file will result in the test being skipped on all
# platforms, build variants, tasks, etc.
#
# The format of this file is as follows:
# - one test per line, with an optional comment (total lines in file < 1,000)
# - comments begin with a hash (#) character and continue to the end of the line
# - lines starting with the comment character and blank lines are ignored
# - specify test names as they are known to the test runner (e.g., /some/test)
# - specify sub-tests of spec tests by an additional slash (/) and the quoted description
#   (e.g., /some/spec/test/"sub-test 1")
# - placing a comment at the end of a line will cause the test runner to output
#   the comment text as the skip reason when the test is skipped
#
# Example entries:
# /skip/entire/test # this will be output by the runner as the skip reason
# /skip/part/of/spec/test/"sub-test description" # this will also be output

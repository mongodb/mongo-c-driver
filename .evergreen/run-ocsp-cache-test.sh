#
# End-to-end test runner for OCSP cache.
#
# Assumptions:
#   Mongod:
#       The script assumes that a mongod is running with TLS enabled. It also assumes that the server certificate will NOT
#       staple a response. This will force the test binary to reach out to an OCSP responder to check the certificates'
#       revocation status.
#   Mock OCSP Responder:
#       This script assumes that a mock OCSP responder is running named "ocsp_mock". It also assumes that the OCSP
#       responder will respond with a certificate status of 'revoked'.
#
# Behavior:
#   This script first runs the test binary 'test-mongoc-cache' which sends a ping command to the mongod. It then waits for 5
#   seconds to give the binary enough time to make the request, and receive and process the response. Since we soft-fail
#   if an OCSP responder is not reachable, receiving a certificate status of 'revoked' is the only way we can be certain
#   our binary reached out to an OCSP responder. We assert a certificate status of 'revoked' in the test binary for both
#   ping commands.
#
#   The test binary will hang (it calls 'raise (SIGSTOP)') after the first ping. This gives us enough time to kill the
#   mock OCSP responder before sending the second ping command to the server. If the cache is used, the expected behavior,
#   then the binary will use the response cached from the first ping command and report a certificate status of 'revoked'.
#   However, if the cache is not used, then second ping command will attempt to reach out to an OCSP responder. Since the
#   only one available was killed by this script and we soft-fail if we cannot contact an OCSP responder the binary
#   will report a certificate status of "good".
#
#   The aforementioned behavior is asserted in the test binary, i.e., both ping commands should fail. If they do,
#   test-mongoc-cache will return EXIT_SUCCESS, otherwise, it will return EXIT_FAILURE.
